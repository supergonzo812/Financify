Financify is a personal finance app to help you keep track of your spending and earnings. It’s perfect for sharing a budget with a spouse, family member, or even just a friend. Your information will be kept up to date with iCloud Syncing so no dollar goes left untracked.

# Onboarding
We get it, you want to get into the app as fast as possible, and we want to get you using the app as fast as possible. That's why we created a brief intro to the app to help you get started.
